# Appointment Management Application

This is a  Java-based application that allows users to manage their appointments and schedules. The system is built using Java and JavaFX and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage. MVC and DAO design were used in this application. The application includes several features to help users manage their appointments and schedules efficiently.

## Features:

* Adding, updating, and deleting appointments
* Displays schedules by month and week using a TableView
* Allows users to choose between the month and week view using tabs or radio buttons
* Adjusts appointment times based on the user's time zone. All appointments are saved in the database as UTC time.
* Input validation and error checks to prevent scheduling appointments outside of business hours, scheduling overlapping appointments for customers, and entering an  incorrect username and password
* Alerts users of upcoming appointments within 15 minutes of logging in
* Generates reports that include the total number of customer appointments by type and month, a schedule for each contact in the organization, and all previous appointments.
* Tracks user activity by recording all user log-in attempts, dates, and timestamps and saving them in a file named login_activity.txt
