# Appointment Management Application

This is a  Java-based application that allows users to manage their appointments and schedules. The system is built using Java and JavaFX and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage. MVC and DAO design were used in this application. The application includes several features to help users manage their appointments and schedules efficiently.

## Features:

* Adding, updating, and deleting appointments
* Displaying schedules by month and week using a TableView
* Allowing users to choose between the month and week view using tabs or radio buttons
* Adjusting appointment times based on the user's time zone
* Input validation and error checks to prevent scheduling appointments outside of business hours, scheduling overlapping appointments for customers, and entering an  incorrect username and password
* Alerting users of upcoming appointments within 15 minutes of logging in
* Generating reports such as the total number of customer appointments by type and month, a schedule for each contact in the organization, and an additional report of the user's choice
* Tracking user activity by recording all user log-in attempts, dates, and timestamps and saving them in a file named login_activity.txt
